# Advent of Code

This repository contains solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) across multiple years, starting in 2024.

## Usage

This project was written for [Deno](https://deno.com/). Make sure you have it installed.

### Solve a Day

You will need to copy your puzzle input into a corresponding file in `inputs/{year}/day{zero-padded day}.txt`.

For example, if you wish to solve Year 2024, Day 1, you will need to copy your input into `inputs/2024/day01.txt`.

Then, you can run the following command:

```shell
deno task solve [YEAR] [DAY]
```

Provide a year (e.g. 2024) and day number (eg. 1 to 25) to get a solution

### Run Tests

All solutions have a unit test to make sure they solve the puzzle.

```shell
deno test
```
